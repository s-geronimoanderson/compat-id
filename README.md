# Compat-id

A machine learning-based communication pattern identifier for distributed systems.


## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

*Note: Currently not intended for deploying on production systems.*

### Prerequisites

**TODO**

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

**TODO**

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

(TODO: End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo)


## Running the tests

(TODO: Explain how to run the automated tests for this system)

### Break down into end to end tests

(TODO: Explain what these tests test and why)

```
(TODO: Give an example)
```

### And coding style tests

(TODO: Explain what these tests test and why)

```
(TODO: Give an example)
```


## Deployment

Currently not intended for deploying on production systems.
